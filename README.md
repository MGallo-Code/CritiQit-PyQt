## **Dependencies**

Before running the project's setup script, ensure the following dependencies are installed on your system:

- **Python 3.9 - 3.13** (PySide6 compatibility):
  - Check your Python version:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
  - If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

# Project Setup

This project uses a virtual environment (`venv`) to manage dependencies. Occasionally, you may encounter issues running the program, particularly related to the **"cocoa" plugin** on macOS. Recreating the virtual environment often resolves these issues.

To simplify this process, we have included a `setup.sh` script. However, there are some constraints to be aware of based on your operating system and shell environment.

## Step 1: Set Up TMDB API Key

To access TMDB content, you need to create a .env file in the root of the project directory and include your custom TMDB API key.

### **Steps to Get Your API Key:**
1. Create a TMDB account at [TMDB Signup](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup?language=en-US) or log in at [TMDB Login](https://www.themoviedb.org/login?language=en-US).
2. Once logged in, visit the [API Settings Page](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
3. Under **API Read Access Token**, copy your API key.

### **Steps to Create .env File:**
1. In the root of your project directory, copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` and replace `your_api_key` with your TMDB API Read Access Token:
   ```
   TMDB_BEARER_TOKEN=your_api_key
   ```

### (Optional) Importing Rating Data from IMDB/TMDB:

#### Importing from IMDB to TMDB

If you want to transfer your ratings from IMDb to this application, you must first transfer these ratings to TMDB. Please refer to this guide on the TMDB website to do so:
[How to Import IMDb Ratings to TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/58a4180b92514165c5001533)

#### Importing TMDB Ratings into CritiQit

When running the application, go to the toolbar menu and choose:
- **File -> Sync TMDB Ratings**.

## Step 2: Supported Environments

### macOS/Linux
The `setup.sh` script is fully supported on macOS and Linux systems with a standard Bash shell.

### Windows
On Windows, the `setup.sh` script **requires a Bash-compatible shell**, such as:
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

If you are not using a Bash-compatible shell (e.g., if you are using Command Prompt or PowerShell), the `setup.sh` script will not work. For these environments, a separate PowerShell script (`setup.ps1`) is provided.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

*These setup scripts create a new virtual environment, clean up any old environments, and install required python dependencies.*

### macOS/Linux
1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh  # Make the script executable
   ./setup.sh         # Run the setup script
   ```

### Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell)
1. Open PowerShell.
2. Run the following command to execute the PowerShell setup script:
   ```powershell
   .\setup.ps1
   ```

## **Common Issues**

### "cocoa" Plugin Errors on macOS

If you encounter errors like:
```
qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin “cocoa” in “”
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized.
```

Recreating the virtual environment using the setup script (`setup.sh`) should resolve the issue.
